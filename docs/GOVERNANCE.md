# Governance (how we work in GitHub)

This project is intentionally GitHub-native. The goal is to make contributing obvious and low-friction.

## Where things go

- **Discussions**: ideas, “what should we build next?”, design debates, early scoping.
- **Issues**: concrete work with acceptance criteria.
- **Pull requests**: code changes. Keep them small and link the Issue/Discussion.
- **Projects**: a single board for triage and “what’s shipping next”.

## Suggested labels

Use a simple label scheme (you can expand later):

- `type:bug`, `type:feature`, `type:chore`, `type:security`
- `tool:<slug>` (ex: `tool:recover`, `tool:refunds`, …)
- `priority:p0`, `priority:p1`, `priority:p2`
- `status:triage`, `status:ready`, `status:in-progress`, `status:blocked`, `status:shipped`

## “What should we build next?”

- Primary thread: `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/discussions/1`
- When an idea becomes specific, open an Issue and link the Discussion.

## Project board (recommended)

Create one GitHub Project with views:
- **Triage** (new issues)
- **Top voted** (if you add voting / reactions)
- **In progress**
- **Ready to ship**
- **Shipped**

Keep it simple; don’t add custom fields until you need them.
