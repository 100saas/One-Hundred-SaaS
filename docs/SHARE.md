# Sharing / recruiting contributors

This is the short version of how to talk about the project.

## The pitch (plain)

We’re building a suite of small tools that replace expensive single‑purpose SaaS.

Everything is built in public:
- requests are Discussions
- work is Issues
- code ships via PRs

PocketBase is the default so contributors can run tools locally quickly.

## Where to send people

- Repo: `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS`
- Start here: `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/discussions/7`
- Request a tool: `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/discussions/8`
- Latest ship note: `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/discussions/48`
- Good first issues:
  - `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22`

## What we want help with

- Better tool READMEs (clear problem/solution + examples)
- Endpoint hardening (avoid 500s)
- Test/verification improvements
- New tools (scoped + small)
