# Licensing

This repository is licensed under **AGPL-3.0** (see `LICENSE`).

## What that means (plain English)

- If you run a modified version of this software and let other people use it over a network, you need to publish your modifications under the same license.
- If you distribute copies, you need to include the same license.

The goal is simple: improvements flow back to the community, especially for hosted/network use.

## “MIT bridges” (optional, where appropriate)

Sometimes we may want a tiny, reusable integration layer that is useful beyond this repo (e.g. a small client, a generic adapter, or a protocol helper).

When we do that, we can place that code in an explicitly marked folder with its **own** `LICENSE` file (MIT), and keep the rest of the tool/kernel under AGPL.

If you’re proposing this, start a Discussion first:
- explain why the code should be MIT (reusability, portability, ecosystem fit),
- keep the surface area small,
- keep it dependency-light.
