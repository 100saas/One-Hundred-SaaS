# Roadmap

We track work in GitHub, not in a separate system.

## Project board

- `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/1`

## “What should we build next?”

Start here:
- `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/discussions/1`

When an idea is clear and scoped, turn it into an Issue and label it:
- `type:feature`
- `tool:<slug>` (or propose a new tool)
- `priority:p0|p1|p2`
