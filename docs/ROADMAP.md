# Roadmap

We track work in GitHub, not in a separate system.

## Project board

- Master roadmap: `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/1`

### Sub-project boards (separate backlogs)

If you prefer focused backlogs instead of one giant board, we also use sub-projects:
- Kernel: `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/2`
- Frontend: `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/3`
- Batch 1 (Tools 1–3): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/4`
- Batch 2 (Tools 4–8): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/5`
- Batch 3 (Tools 9–13): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/6`
- Batch 4 (Tools 14–18): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/7`
- Batch 5 (Tools 19–23): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/8`
- Batch 6 (Tools 24–28): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/9`
- Batch 7 (Tools 29–33): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/10`
- Batch 8 (Tools 34–38): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/11`
- Batch 9 (Tools 39–43): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/12`
- Batch 10 (Tools 44–48): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/13`
- Batch 11 (Tools 49–50): `https://github.com/orgs/100saas/projects/14`

This board is the source of truth for:
- backlog (what we want to build)
- in progress (what’s being worked on)
- roadmap targets (rough dates)

## How to navigate

1) Start with the Project board (Board view).
2) Open an Epic (issues titled `Epic: ...`) to see what we’re building in that area.
3) Pick an issue labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

Useful queries:
- Epics: `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+in%3Atitle+Epic%3A`
- Good first issues: `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22`

## Project fields (what they mean)

- `Status`: Backlog/Todo/In Progress/Blocked/Review/Done (kanban)
- `Priority`: P0/P1/P2 (rough urgency)
- `Work Type`: Epic/Feature/Bug/Docs/Chore
- `Batch`: Kernel, Frontend, or Batch ranges (1–3, 4–8, ...)
- `Target`: a rough date (best-effort; not a promise)

## Stack standard (important)

We keep a uniform stack so contributors can move between tools quickly:
- `docs/STACK.md`

## “What should we build next?”

Start here:
- `https://github.com/100saas/One-Hundred-SaaS/discussions/1`

When an idea is clear and scoped, turn it into an Issue and label it:
- `type:feature`
- `tool:<slug>` (or propose a new tool)
- `priority:p0|p1|p2`
