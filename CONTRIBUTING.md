# Contributing

## Where to start

- For ideas and “what should we build next?”, use Discussions.
- For bugs or scoped work, use Issues.
- For code changes, open a PR and link the Issue/Discussion.

## Rules (so this stays sane)

- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Security basics first (auth/rate limits/safe defaults) before feature growth.
- Do not commit secrets. PRs that include keys/tokens will be rejected.
